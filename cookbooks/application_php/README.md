Description
===========

This cookbook is designed to be able to describe and deploy PHP web applications. Currently supported:

* PHP
* Apache2 with mod\_php

Note that this cookbook provides the PHP-specific bindings for the `application` cookbook; you will find general documentation in that cookbook.

Other application stacks may be supported at a later date.

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

The following Opscode cookbooks are dependencies:

* application
* apache2
* php

Resources/Providers
==========

The LWRPs provided by this cookbook are not meant to be used by themselves; make sure you are familiar with the `application` cookbook before proceeding.

php
---

The `php` sub-resource LWRP deals with deploying PHP webapps from an SCM repository. It uses the `deploy_revision` LWRP to perform the bulk of its tasks, and many concepts and parameters map directly to it. Check the documentation for `deploy_revision` for more information.

PHP applications have no standard convention for database configuration; your application cookbook must provide a template if needed.

# Attribute Parameters

- packages: an Array of PEAR packages to install
- database\_master\_role: if a role name is provided, a Chef search will be run to find a node with than role in the same environment as the current role. If a node is found, its IP address will be used when rendering the context file, but see the "Database block parameters" section below
- local\_settings\_file: the name of the local settings file to be generated by template. Defaults to "LocalSettings.php"
- settings\_template: the name of template that will be rendered to create the local settings file. Defaults to "#{local\_settings\_file}.erb"
- database: a block containing additional parameters for configuring the database connection (see below)

# Database block parameters

The database block can accept any method, which will result in an entry being created in the `@database` Hash which is passed to the context template. See the examples below for more information.

mod\_php\_apache2
-----------------

The `mod_php_apache2` sub-resource LWRP configures Apache and mod\_php to run the application by creating a virtual host.

# Attribute Parameters

- server\_aliases: an Array of server aliases
- webapp\_template: the template to render to create the virtual host configuration. Defaults to "php.conf.erb"

Usage
=====

A sample application that needs a database connection:

    application "phpvirtualbox" do
      path "/usr/local/www/sites/phpvirtualbox"
      owner node[:apache][:user]
      group node[:apache][:user]
      repository "..."
      deploy_key "..."
      revision "4_0_7"
      packages ["php-soap"]

      php do
        database_master_role "database_master"
        local_settings_file "config.php"
      end

      mod_php_apache2
    end

This will result in a `config.php` file getting created from a `config.php.erb` template that must exist in your application cookbook.

You can invoke any method on the database block:

    application "my-app" do
      path "/usr/local/my-app"
      repository "..."
      revision "..."

      php do
        database_master_role "database_master"
        database do
          database 'name'
          quorum 2
          replicas %w[Huey Dewey Louie]
        end
      end
    end

The corresponding entries will be passed to the context template:

    <%= @database['quorum']
    <%= @database['replicas'].join(',') %>
